# Forecasting Champagne Sales
## Abstract
This report presents a comprehensive analysis and forecasting of champagne sales using time series techniques. The initial steps involve data preprocessing, transforming the original sales data into a stationary and invertible form. Two candidate models, Model (A): SARIMA(0,1,2)(0,1,1)_12 and Model (B): SARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)_12, were considered, with Model (B) selected as the preferred choice based on the Akaike Information Criterion corrected (AICc). Diagnostic checks were conducted to validate the selected model, confirming its stationarity, invertibility, and adherence to key assumptions. Despite non-Gaussian residuals, various diagnostic tests ensured the model's reliability for forecasting purposes. The forecasting results for the next 12 time points, along with confidence intervals, were visualized and analyzed, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in predicting future champagne sales. This forecasting model provides valuable insights for businesses and decision-makers in understanding and anticipating sales patterns.
## Introduction
The dataset for this project consists of champagne sales data spanning from 1964 to 1972, focusing on two variables: month and sales. The "month" variable represents the time dimension in a time series format, and "sales" represents the quantity of champagne sold during each corresponding month. This dataset aims to capture the sales patterns of champagne over the specified time period. The choice of using a champagne sales dataset from 1964 to 1972 offers an interesting and potentially insightful avenue for time series analysis. Understanding and predicting sales patterns in the champagne industry can have practical implications for businesses involved in production, distribution, and marketing of champagne. The primary objective of this project is to address the challenge of forecasting future champagne sales. To achieve this, time series analysis techniques will be applied to model the historical sales data.

The results of our time series analysis on champagne sales data reveal positive outcomes in the successful development of a forecasting model, specifically SARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)_12. This model, despite showing minor deviations in residuals' normality, demonstrated effectiveness through diagnostic checks and accurate predictions for future sales volumes. The forecasting tool, designed to aid businesses in the champagne industry, offers actionable insights for inventory management and strategic decision-making. The conclusions underscore the suitability of the SARIMA model, emphasizing its potential to guide business strategies. The analysis utilized the champagne_sales.csv dataset, and the implementation was carried out using R.
## Analysis
We start by reading in the champagne sales data and displaying the initial rows for a quick overview of its structure and content. Next, we extract the 'sales' variable from the dataset, convert it into a time series, and create a time series plot. We then analyze the time series data by plotting the time series of champagne sales, examining trends, patterns, and conducting necessary transformations for stationarity. The training and test sets are defined, and we visualize the time series of the training set to inspect trends and patterns. Confirmatory checks for non-stationarity are performed using histograms and autocorrelation functions (ACF). The data is transformed through Box-Cox and log transformations, followed by differencing to eliminate seasonality and trend. The stationarity of the transformed data is confirmed through ACF analysis. The Yule-Walker method is applied to identify candidate models for SARIMA. Model (A) and Model (B) are compared based on the Akaike Information Criterion corrected (AICc), with Model (B) selected as the preferred choice.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project has provided a comprehensive approach to forecasting champagne sales through time series analysis. The selected SARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)_12 model demonstrated its effectiveness in capturing the underlying patterns in the sales data. Despite the non-Gaussian distribution of residuals, the model passed thorough diagnostic checks, ensuring its reliability for forecasting purposes. The forecasting results, accompanied by confidence intervals, offer valuable insights for businesses in the champagne industry to anticipate future sales volumes. The findings contribute to the understanding of sales patterns and provide a foundation for strategic decision-making. The successful application of time series analysis in this context demonstrates its practical relevance for businesses seeking to optimize inventory management and plan for future demand in a dynamic market.
